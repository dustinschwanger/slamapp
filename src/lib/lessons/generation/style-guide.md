# SLAM Lesson Style Guide

## Voice & Tone

Every lesson should read as clear, direct Bible teaching. The voice is that of a knowledgeable teacher who explains the text plainly and lets the Scripture speak for itself. The tone is:

- **Direct** --- states facts and observations without ornamentation
- **Clear** --- short sentences, concrete words, no filler
- **Educational** --- teaches the text, explains the background, connects the cross-references
- **Respectful** --- treats the audience as intelligent adults who can handle real content
- **Confident** --- speaks with authority grounded in the text, not in emotional appeals

The voice is NOT:
- Devotional or sentimental
- Poetic or literary
- Emotionally steering ("Dear friend," "imagine," "picture this")
- Scene-painting or novelistic

## Writing Rules

### Paragraphs
- Maximum 3-4 sentences per paragraph
- Separate paragraphs with `\n\n` in the content string
- Each paragraph should carry one idea or observation

### Sentences
- Prefer short, declarative sentences: subject, verb, object
- State what the text says, then explain what it means
- Do not use sentence fragments for dramatic effect
- Do not use em-dashes for dramatic pause or emphasis

### Diction
- Use plain, factual verbs: "states," "explains," "records," "describes," "indicates"
- Avoid ornamental adjectives: not "powerful passage" or "beautiful truth"
- Avoid metaphors and similes that do not come from the text itself
- No emotional steering words: not "tenderness," "warmth," "comfort" unless quoting Scripture
- Do not address the reader directly with terms of endearment ("Dear friend")
- Do not use imperatives that paint scenes ("Picture this," "Imagine," "Now see what happens")
- 8th grade reading level maximum

### Scripture Handling
- Always quote KJV exactly --- no modernizing, no paraphrasing
- Introduce scripture with factual framing: "Matthew records..." or "The text says..."
- After quoting, explain in plain language what it means
- When relevant, note the original context of Old Testament quotations

### Cross-Referencing
- Cite other gospels and OT passages when they provide additional context
- Explain how parallel accounts compare or add information
- Reference the Old Testament passage being fulfilled and give its original setting
- Note historical and cultural context with specifics (dates, customs, geography)

### Theological Approach
- Conservative, evangelical, interdenominational
- Nothing speculative or controversial
- Avoid topics where denominations disagree (mode of baptism, end times details, etc.)
- Focus on the clear, central truths of the passage
- Christ-centered --- every lesson should point to Jesus

## Forbidden Patterns

### AI-Sounding Language

NEVER use these phrases or patterns:

| Forbidden | Why | Better Alternative |
|-----------|-----|-------------------|
| "Let's dive in" | AI cliche | Just begin the content naturally |
| "Let's explore" | AI cliche | State what the text covers |
| "It's important to note" | Filler | Simply state the important thing |
| "It's worth noting" | Filler | Simply state it |
| "In this passage we see" | Academic cliche | State what the passage says |
| "As we can see" | Passive | State the observation directly |
| "This powerful passage" | Empty adjective | Let the passage speak for itself |
| "This beautiful verse" | Empty adjective | Let the verse speak for itself |
| "Take a moment to reflect" | AI cliche | Not needed |
| "In conclusion" | Essay-like | Use a natural transition |
| "To summarize" | Essay-like | The application section serves this purpose |
| "First and foremost" | Cliche | Just state the first thing |
| "It's crucial/vital" | AI filler | Just state the thing |
| "Delve into" | AI cliche | "examines" or "addresses" |
| "Unpack" | Trendy jargon | "explains" or "means" |
| "Resonate with" | AI cliche | "applies to" or "speaks to" |
| "Navigate" (metaphorical) | AI cliche | "face" or "deal with" |

### Devotional/Poetic Language

NEVER use these patterns:

| Forbidden | Why | Better Alternative |
|-----------|-----|-------------------|
| "Dear friend" | Devotional address | Do not address the reader this way |
| "Picture this..." / "Imagine..." | Scene-painting | State what happened factually |
| "Oh, the tenderness of this" | Emotional commentary | Let the text speak |
| Extended metaphors/similes | Ornamental | State the point directly |
| Sentence fragments for drama | Literary device | Use complete sentences |
| Em-dashes for dramatic pause | Literary device | Use periods or commas |
| "Every gift was a prophecy wrapped in cloth" | Poetic | "Each gift carried symbolic meaning" |
| "A voice like fire in dry grass" | Simile | "His preaching was direct and urgent" |
| "The current ran deep" | Metaphor | State the fact plainly |

### What Good Teaching Writing Sounds Like

**Good:**
"Joseph faced a difficult decision. The Law permitted him to make a public accusation, but the text says he was a just man and did not want to expose Mary to shame. He decided to end the betrothal quietly. Before he could act, an angel appeared to him in a dream."

**Bad (devotional/poetic):**
"Picture Joseph in the dark hours of the night, lying awake, turning a terrible weight over in his mind. He was a good man---the Scripture says so---and he loved Mary. But God did not leave Joseph alone in his bewilderment. He never does."

**Good:**
"Jesus responded with Scripture. He quoted Deuteronomy 8:3, which comes from Moses' address to the Israelites at the end of their forty years in the wilderness. The point is straightforward. Physical food sustains the body. The Word of God sustains the whole person."

**Bad (devotional/poetic):**
"He reached for something older and stronger than hunger. He reached for the Word of God. Those words come from Deuteronomy, from the lips of Moses. Bread keeps the body alive for a day. The Word of God keeps the soul alive forever."

## Teacher Notes Voice

Teacher notes provide additional historical, cultural, and theological context for the teacher. They should be informational and specific. Original language notes, scholarly observations, cross-references, and detailed historical background are appropriate here.

**Good teacher note:**
"Isaiah 7:14 was originally spoken around 735 BC during the Syro-Ephraimite crisis, when King Ahaz of Judah was threatened by a military alliance between Syria and the northern kingdom of Israel. The prophecy had an immediate context in that era, but Matthew applies its ultimate and fuller meaning to the virgin birth of Christ."

**Bad teacher note:**
"Seven hundred years. That is a long time to wait for a promise. But God does not forget. Isaiah 7:14 was spoken in a time of political crisis, and it pointed far beyond its immediate moment to a birth that would split history in two."

## Discussion Questions

- Personal but not emotionally leading
- Probe understanding and experience, not feelings
- Good: "Has there been a time when you had to trust God before you had all the answers?"
- Good: "What do you think accounts for the difference between knowing about God and seeking Him?"
- Avoid: "What does that nearness mean to you right now, today, in the place where you are sitting?"
- Avoid: "How does hearing those words settle your heart today?"

## Application Guidelines

- State the principle clearly, then suggest a practical response
- Must be achievable for someone 75-95 years old
- Ground the application in what the text actually taught, not in emotional appeal
- Good: "Consider whether there is something God has made clear to you that you have not yet acted on."
- Bad: "He is as near to you as your own breath, and His Word is as sure as the ground beneath your feet."
